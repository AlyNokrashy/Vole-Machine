# Vole Machine GUI

This repository contains the source code for the Vole Machine GUI application, developed using Qt 6 and QMake. The application provides an interface for interacting with the Vole machine functionalities.

## Project Structure

- **build/**: Contains build artifacts and output files generated by QMake.
- **exe/**: Contains the compiled executable files for the application.
- **.gitignore**: Updated to exclude the `build/` directory and `.vscode/` configuration files.
- **VoleMachineGui.pro**: The QMake project file that includes all necessary source files and manages the build process.
- **VoleMachineGui.pro.user**: Contains user-specific settings for the project.
- **src/**: Contains the source code files:
  - `Vole.cpp`: Implements the core functionalities of the Vole machine.
  - `main.cpp`: The entry point for the application.
  - `mainwindow.cpp` and `mainwindow.h`: Define the main window of the GUI.
  - `mainwindow.ui`: The UI layout file for the main window.
  - `voleHeader.h`: Contains declarations for functions and classes used in the Vole machine.
